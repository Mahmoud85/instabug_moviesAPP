# MyReads Project
This is a small app Developed as part of Instabug assessment for Me 'Mahmoud Fathy' as a react Devloper
Developing this app I focused upon the below points
* making the code as flat and simple as possible 
* I didn't use any technique that I think it is not necessary for such small app
* I managed to avoid using third party libararies as I can and kept it minimal
* Because some movies has long desc , I removed some of the text as I think there must be a details page
* The app doesn't handle presisting my movies data between sessions
